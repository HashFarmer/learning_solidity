solc - solcjs
// solcjs
Note: The solc-js project is derived from the C++ solc by using Emscripten which means that both use the same compiler source code. solc-js can be used in JavaScript projects directly (such as Remix). Please refer to the solc-js repository for instructions.
// solc
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum
sudo apt-get update
